# Memory_Allocation

This program demonstrates a custom memory allocator implemented in C++. It includes features like dynamic memory allocation, deallocation, and management of memory fragmentation. The allocator uses a linked list to track free and allocated blocks, providing mechanisms to split free blocks during allocation and merge adjacent free blocks during deallocation to optimize memory usage. Additionally, it tracks memory usage statistics, including total allocated memory, peak usage, and fragmentation percentage. The program also benchmarks the custom allocator against the standard library functions (malloc() and free()), providing insights into performance differences.

The project showcases vital skills like low-level memory management, linked list manipulation, algorithm design, and performance optimization. These are critical for understanding how memory works at a granular level, especially in performance-critical applications like embedded systems, game engines, or operating systems. By working on this program, you demonstrate your ability to design and implement efficient resource management systems, debug low-level issues, and compare performance metricsâ€”skills highly valued in systems programming and software engineering roles.
